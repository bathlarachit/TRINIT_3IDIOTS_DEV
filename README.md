### PS
Rooting for a good cause, Philanthropic organizations use their resources to improve society. However, they need to be equipped to do so. On the other side, local non-profit organizations (NGOs) rely on the funding provided by various funders. In todayâ€™s world, there is a growing need for an effective platform to connect philanthropists and NGOs to help positively impact society. Currently, the process of finding and supporting the right cause can take time and effort, with limited transparency into the impact of the donations. 

### Objectives: 
* To create a centralized platform that makes it easy for philanthropists to discover and support NGOs working in areas they are passionate about. 
* To provide philanthropists with comprehensive information about each NGO, including their mission, history, and impact, to help them make informed decisions. 
* To improve transparency and accountability in the donation process by providing real-time updates on the use of funds and the impact of donations. 
* To provide NGOs with a way to reach a larger audience and secure the funding they need to carry out their missions. 
* To facilitate better collaboration and communication between philanthropists and NGOs to help maximize the impact of their efforts. 

### Implemented Features 
* Profile creation for NGOs and users/philanthropists: The NGOs can create profiles that include information about their previous works, their end goal, and their plans as to how they can achieve their goal and their overall impact on the environment and society, and their funding needs. Philanthropists can create
profiles that include information about their donation preferences, such as what kind of NGOs they wish to donate to. 
* Search and filter functionality: Users can search and filter NGOs based on various criteria such as location, impact area, type of NGO, etc. 
* Suggestion algorithm: The platform can use an algorithm to suggest some NGOs to the users based on the type of NGOs they wish to support. 
* Communication tools: The platform should include mechanisms for the users to communicate with different NGOs(text message, video meeting, etc.) to learn more about that particular NGO. 
* Community features: Platform can allow users to join groups, share ideas, and connect with other NGOs/fellow philanthropists. 
* News and events: Platform can also feature the latest news and events related to new NGOs and other societal/environmental welfare programs. 
Brownie Points 
* Progress/Activity Tracking: Users who have donated to an NGO should be able to see how much the NGO has received in donations and how these donations are put to use, as in, what they have planned for the future, and when each of their activities is scheduled. 
* Crowdfunding facility: If a user wishes to conduct a philanthropic event but requires funds, the platform can provide the facility to run a crowdfunding campaign. 
* Provide UPI/Payment support.
